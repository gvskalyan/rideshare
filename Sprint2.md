# Sprint 3 Outline and Documentation

## Frontend

### Integrating Login and Signup page
Integrated the login and signup pages with the backend database to authenticate the user before they can use the functionalities of a website.

### Navigation Bar

Built a navigation bar to navigate easily through websites.

### About Us

Built a webpage for the user to land after logging in. This page will be more customised according to the user who logged in. Currently the page displays the goal of the website.

### Find a Ride Webpage

A new webpage is built that takes inputs from users who are logged in to search the ride in the route they wish to travel. Inputs taken from the user are Starting Location, Destination and the Date. These inputs should be used to retrieve the rides from the database.

A new webpage is built that takes inputs from the logged in user to post the ride. These inputs should be entered into the database.
